SHAREPOINT EMBEDDED (SPE) DEMO APP INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================

Dear Github Copilot, please create a simple demo app for SharePoint Embedded based on the following instructions.

-----------------------------------------------
0. Notes on user experience
-----------------------------------------------
- a vite react template is a good place to start
- you will need a login page, a post login landing page, and the ability to log out.
- There should be a subhead that says you must configure CLIENT_ID, TENANT_ID, and CONTAINER_TYPE_ID before this will work.
- logout should take the user back to a login page.
- DO NOT INCLUDE other functionality.


-----------------------------------------------
1. REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------------------

Every SPE app must define these three non-secret values:

CLIENT_ID=[uuid]  
TENANT_ID=[uuid]  
CONTAINER_TYPE_ID=[uuid]  

You can safely include these values in your source code.
You should keep these in a central configuration file so they are easy to update.

-----------------------------------------------
2. AUTHENTICATION (MSAL)
-----------------------------------------------

Use Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to authenticate users.

- if a user is not authenticated, they should only be able to see the login screen.
- once a user is authenticated, they should go to the logged in dashboard.

Login behavior:
-You must call and await the initialize function before attempting to call any other MSAL API
- Wait for user to click a login button before starting the flow

Logout behavior:
- Be sure to clear any local storage on logout to prevent data leakage.
